🔄 MIPS Multi-Unit Converter (9-in-1)

A menu-driven 9-in-1 Unit Converter developed in MIPS Assembly Language as a 3rd Semester academic project for the Assembly Language Programming / CALD course.

This project demonstrates how low-level programming can be used to solve real-world problems efficiently using registers, branching, loops, and system calls.

📚 About the Project

The MIPS Multi-Unit Converter allows users to convert values between multiple units across nine different categories.
It is fully interactive and designed with modular labels to ensure clarity, scalability, and easy navigation.

The program has been tested on MARS and QtSPIM simulators.

🚀 Features

📌 Interactive, menu-driven interface

🔢 Supports 9 conversion categories:

Temperature

Length

Mass

Time

Area

Volume

Speed

Energy

🔁 Multiple unit options under each category

⚙️ Efficient use of:

Loops

Conditional branching

Registers

System calls

✅ Input validation and formatted output

🧩 Modular, well-commented, and easy-to-read code

🧠 How It Works

User selects a conversion category from the main menu

Chooses the source unit and target unit

Enters the value to convert

Program calculates and displays the result

User can repeat conversions or exit

The program is structured using labels and branching for smooth navigation between menus.
